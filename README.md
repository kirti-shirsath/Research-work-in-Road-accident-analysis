Comparative Analysis of Urban vs Rural Road Accidents in India Using Data Analytics

**🎯 Research Objective

The goal of this study is to:

Compare accident frequency, fatality rates, and severity between urban and rural areas
Identify spatio-temporal patterns and high-risk zones
Examine factors such as road type, infrastructure quality, medical response delay
Provide data-backed recommendations for improving road safety across India


🧠 Motivation

India reports over 150,000 road fatalities annually, with a sharp contrast between:

Urban Areas: Higher number of accidents due to congestion
Rural Areas: Higher fatality rate due to poor medical response & road conditions

This gap motivated a comparative analysis to support policy-making, infrastructure planning, and traffic management strategies.

🧠Methodology

-Data Sources
MoRTH (Road Accidents in India Reports 2017–2021)
Data.gov.in datasets
OGD (Open Government Data India)

-Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Power BI (visual comparative dashboard)
Excel (preprocessing and cleaning)

Techniques

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Trend & pattern analysis
Severity index calculations
Urban–rural comparative statistical evaluation

📊 Key Findings

Urban regions report 60%+ accidents, mainly due to dense traffic, speeding, and pedestrian conflicts.
Rural regions show 60–65% of fatalities, caused by:
Bad road infrastructure
Delayed medical facilities
Poor signage & lighting
Fatalities increased in rural areas during 2020–2021 (COVID period).
Accident hotspots identified using Python visualizations.

----Recommendations

-Urban Areas
Strict enforcement
Smart traffic systems
Improved pedestrian pathways

-Rural Areas
Rapid trauma-care networks
Road upgrades & lighting
Awareness & helmet-seatbelt enforcement
